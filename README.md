# Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA): Riemannian Neural Fields

### Overview
**Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** is a forward-only learning framework that models intelligence as the continuous organization of information over space and time.  
This repository introduces the **Riemannian Neural Field** architecture — a geometric extension of SKA — where learning is represented as smooth propagation across an information manifold rather than as gradient-based optimization.

The approach replaces back-propagation with a direct principle of **entropy-driven knowledge accumulation**, producing systems that learn continuously, deterministically, and without weight reversal.

### Core Idea
Traditional machine-learning systems rely on statistical error minimization.  
SKA reformulates learning as a **physical process**: information flows through a structured field, adapting locally while preserving global consistency.  
The field’s geometry evolves with the data itself, allowing the model to self-organize and discover architecture dynamically.

This design leads to:
- **Forward-only dynamics** — knowledge is never unlearned, only refined.
- **Intrinsic geometry** — the structure of learning emerges from the data’s entropy and density, not from predefined architectures.
- **Dimensional universality** — the same framework operates in 3D, 4D, or higher-dimensional information spaces without modification.

### Conceptual Highlights
- **Information Manifold:**  
  Each learning process unfolds on a manifold whose local geometry reflects the organization of knowledge.  
  The manifold evolves with entropy, enabling adaptive learning pathways.

- **Geodesic Learning Paths:**  
  Instead of minimizing a loss function, the system follows the shortest information paths—geodesics—through the evolving knowledge field.

- **Entropy-Based Adaptation:**  
  Learning is guided by changes in entropy, producing self-regularizing models that remain stable and interpretable over time.

- **Riemannian Field Architecture:**  
  Neural activations are treated as a continuous field.  
  Connectivity and structure arise naturally from the information landscape rather than from manual design.

- **Scalability Across Dimensions:**  
  The same mechanism applies to spatial (3D), spatiotemporal (4D), or higher-order cognitive fields (5D+), offering a unified view of learning across physical and informational domains.

### Why It Matters
Modern AI systems learn by statistical approximation; they require massive data and periodic retraining.  
SKA proposes a **continuous-time, geometry-aware alternative** that maintains stability and interpretability while adapting in real time.  
This could impact:
- **Autonomous reasoning systems**  
- **Financial and physical modeling**  
- **Dynamic cognitive simulations**  
- **Real-time learning agents**
