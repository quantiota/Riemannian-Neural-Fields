## 🌌 Internship Offer: Computational Geometry & Neural Field Simulation

### **Title**
**Research Intern – Riemannian Neural Fields & Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)**

### **Organization**
**Quantiota Research Lab**  
*(AI Research Initiative — SKA Framework)*

📆 **Start Date:** January 2026  
🌍 **Remote | Duration:** 3–6 months | **Flexible schedule**

---

## 🧠 About the Project
The **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** framework redefines learning as an **entropy-minimizing, forward-only process**.  
This internship extends SKA into **continuous Riemannian neural fields**, where knowledge propagates along **geodesics of an information manifold**.

You will contribute to the implementation of the paper:  
> *Bouarfa Mahi (2026). “Structured Knowledge Accumulation: Geodesic Learning Paths and Architecture Discovery in Riemannian Neural Fields.”*

The work bridges **information theory, differential geometry, and computational neuroscience**, creating a novel pathway toward **real-time, geometry-aware AI systems**.

---

## 🚀 Your Mission
- Implement the **Riemannian SKA Neural Fields pipeline** in Python.  
- Use **FEniCS** for finite element computations of entropy gradients.  
- Employ **pydec** for discrete exterior calculus and mesh-based geodesic computation.  
- Integrate **geomstats** for Riemannian metric tensor operations.  
- Combine **PyTorch** for tensor dynamics and **noise** for neuron density generation.  
- Visualize geodesic learning paths and entropy evolution using tools such as **Matplotlib**, **Paraview**, or similar.  
- Document experiments and participate in **weekly research discussions** on geometric learning.  

---

## 🧩 Required Skills
- Solid programming experience in **Python** and numerical computing.  
- Familiarity with **differential geometry**, **information theory**, or **field-based learning concepts**.  
- Ability to work independently and reason across theoretical and computational layers.  

---

## 🎓 Preferred Background
- MSc or PhD student in **Applied Mathematics**, **Computational Physics**, **Machine Learning**, or **Engineering Physics**.  
- Prior experience with **Riemannian geometry**, **finite element methods (FEM)**, or **differential topology** is a strong plus.  

---

## ⏱ Duration & Modality
- **3 to 6 months (flexible)**  
- Fully **remote internship** — collaboration through the **AI Agent Host infrastructure** (Docker + VSCode + QuestDB + Grafana + Claude).  
- Weekly progress meetings and **mentorship by Bouarfa Mahi**, founder of the SKA framework.  

---

## 🌍 What You’ll Gain
- Hands-on experience in **3D, 4D, and 5D geometric machine learning** and **differential AI architectures**.  
- Exposure to **real-time AI infrastructure** (QuestDB, Grafana).  
- **Co-authorship opportunities** on future SKA research papers for significant contributions.  
- Access to a unique **interdisciplinary research environment** connecting **physics, information theory, and AI**.
